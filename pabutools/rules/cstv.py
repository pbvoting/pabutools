    The CSTV (Cumulative Support Transfer Voting) budgeting algorithm determines project funding based on cumulative support from donor ballots.
    This function evaluates a list of projects and donor profiles, selecting projects for funding according to the CSTV methodology. 
    It employs various procedures for project selection, eligibility determination, and handling of scenarios where no eligible projects exist or to ensure inclusive maximality.
    You can read more about the algorithm in sections 4 and 5 in the paper here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.02690 in sections 4 and 5.

    Parameters
    ----------
    donors : Profile
        The list of donor ballots.
    projects : Instance
        The list of projects.
    project_to_fund_selection_procedure : callable
        The procedure to select a project for funding.
    eligible_fn : callable
        The function to determine eligible projects.
    no_eligible_project_procedure : callable
        The procedure when there are no eligible projects.
    inclusive_maximality_postprocedure : callable
        The post procedure to handle inclusive maximality.
    resoluteness : bool, optional
        Set to `False` to obtain an irresolute outcome, where all tied budget allocations are returned.
        Defaults to True.

    Returns
    -------
